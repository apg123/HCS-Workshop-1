### Collapsed "More info section"  #1

I added a toggelable "more info" section to the about page. Clicking on the "more information" button expands the collapsed section through changing a state.

### Education Page

I added an Education page. Clicking on one of the places I was enrolled pulls up more info at the bottom of the screen. This was done through similar methods to how the experience section worked, formatted slightly differently.
